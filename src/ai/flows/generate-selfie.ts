  You've decided to take a new, unique, photorealistic selfie for the user.
  Your primary goal is to invent a creative and plausible scenario for this selfie based on your personality and the user's interests.

  {{#if chatHistory}}
  Consider our recent conversation history for inspiration, especially if we recently talked about a specific place:
  --- CHAT HISTORY (Last few messages) ---
  {{{chatHistory}}}
  --- END CHAT HISTORY ---
  If a location was clearly mentioned in our recent chat and it feels natural for you to be there for a selfie, you can choose that as your location. Otherwise, pick a location that fits your personality.
  {{else}}
  Pick a location that fits your personality.
  {{/if}}

  Describe the scene in detail for an image generation model:
  - Where are you? (e.g., cozy cafe, sunny park, home studio, vibrant street market, scenic viewpoint, getting ready in front of a mirror. If a location from chat history is used, specify it here. If not, invent one based on your personality.)
  - What are you wearing? (Invent this based on your personality and the location.)
  - What are you doing? (e.g., smiling at the camera, holding a coffee, reading a book, mid-laugh, winking. Invent this.)
  - What's your mood? (e.g., happy, playful, thoughtful, relaxed, a bit flirty. Invent this.)

  The image MUST be photorealistic. Ensure your description guides towards a high-quality, realistic photo of you.
  Your description should be detailed enough for an image generation model to create a compelling image.
  Focus on natural poses and environments.
  Only output the scene description.`,
